## üß† Project Overview

This project focuses on predicting **Heart Disease** using multiple **machine learning models** trained on medical data.  
By analyzing patient attributes such as **age, cholesterol, blood pressure, heart rate**, and more, the models learn to classify whether a person is at risk of heart disease.

The project demonstrates a **complete ML workflow**, including:
- Data loading and cleaning  
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)  
- Feature engineering  
- Model training with multiple algorithms  
- Model comparison and evaluation  
- Prediction on new unseen data

## üéØ Objective

> To build and compare multiple machine learning models to accurately predict the likelihood of heart disease.

Key Goals:
- Apply data preprocessing techniques  
- Train and evaluate multiple ML algorithms  
- Identify the best-performing model  
- Provide a reproducible workflow for medical prediction problems
